# M&B Warband Linux Modfix (Steam Workshop installation)
The purpose of this tool is to automate the correct installation of M&B Warband mods that are installed via the Steam Workshop on a Linux system. For me (and it seems like other people on forums too) the Workshop mods are always installed in a directory which is not recognized by M&B Warband itself. Because i got annoyed by always manually copying the respective mods to the correct directory and renaming them (Steam Workshop id to the real mod name) i thought i could automate that and here we are!
